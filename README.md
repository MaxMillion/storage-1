==========

Storage.js is a NodeJS library that standarizes common available via `npm` libraries like `pkgcloud` and abstracts away differences (especially within callbacks). Just write a simple implementation and leave configuration up to your users.

* Available storage providers:
	* Rackspace
	* Amazon
	* Azure
	* Openshift
	* HP
	* Local disk
	* MongoDB

* To be included soon:
	* Dropbox, Google Drive
	* You tell me :)

* After initial release
	* (S)FTP - due to lack of nice, up-to-date modules, this is for now on hold.

> More providers will be added by community requests (feel free to create an issue).

## Installation

*Note: Work in progress*. Although it's still work in progress, feel free to fork or do the custom install via `npm`. Further details will be published soon.

## Configuration

After requiring for the first time, invoke either `init` or `add` method by passing configuration object.

```js
var Storage = require('storage');

// #1 option
Storage.init({
	myProvider: {
		provider: Storage.Providers.AmazonS3
		container: '',
		key: '',
		keyId: ''
	},
	// other providers you need in your app
	{...}
});

// #2 option
Storage.add('myProvider', {
	provider: Storage.Providers.AmazonS3
	container: '',
	key: '',
	keyId: ''
});

// Call as many times as you want
Storage.add('otherProvider', {...});

Storage.get('myProvider', function (err, client) {
	// do your job
});
```

Configuration object should always contain `provider` key with either `Storage.Providers` brought to you by default or a custom package from npm attached via e.g. `require()`. After that, include other, provider-specific keys.

## Usage

**Uploading**

```js
Storage.get('myProvider', function (err, client) {
	if (err) return;
	client.upload('/path/to/your/file', '/remote/path', function (err, result) {
        // do your job
    });
});

```
Result object we receive on successful callback looks like the following one:

```js
{
	container: 'container_name',
	path: 'path_to_file' // relative to container,
	filename: 'file_name',
	url: 'full_url_to_a_file'
}
```

**Removing**

```js
Storage.get('myProvider', function (err, client) {
	if (err) return;
	client.remove('/remote/path', function (err) {
		// do your job
	});
});
```

Error object is empty when operation was successful.

**Downloading**

```js
Storage.get('myProvider', function (err, client) {
	if (err) return;
	client.download('/remote/path', '/local/path', function (err) {
		// do your job
	});
});
```

Error object is empty when operation was successful.

**See detailed provider-specific docs for better explanation of above methods and their meaning.**

## Motivation

If you ever wanted to implement storage integration right in your application - we got you covered. You've probably encountered problems with different libraries, especially if you wanted to integrate two or three providers, just to give your users a better choice. That's why `Storage.js` was created. Wrapping multiple libraries and creating simple abstraction layer for them allows you to easily add about 5 providers at once!

## API Reference

Will be published soon under github pages. To generate it on your own, simply run `gulp doc` task.

## Tests

With our 100% code coverage, we believe they are important. To run them by yourself, simply type `npm test`. For code coverage, use `gulp coverage`. Remember to delete html files generated by that command by executing `gulp remove-coverage`.

## Contributors

You are welcome! Feel free to submit bugs, create issues and do pull requests. Take a look at our Api reference located above and dive into the project. Feels like we are missing another provider? Just do it!

## Thanks

Special thanks to maintainers of:
- [`pkgcloud`](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud) for providing cloud integrations for Azure, HP, Rackspace, OpenShift and Amazon.
- [`gridfs-stream`](https://github.com/aheckmann/gridfs-stream) for MongoDB layer
